Science-Code-Tools
==================

Helps scientists automate good software engineering practices to improve maintainability and save future coders from grief.

Science Code Tools comprise a unified collection of tools to help
scientists solve the following software engineering problems: 

* Documentation, Code commentary: for other scientists and developers
* Managing dependencies,
* Assuring quality,
* Packaging and distribution...among others to come.


Languages Supported
-------------------

* Perl
* R
* Python


Documentation
-------------
Code comments for other coding scientists and developers.


Managing Dependencies
---------------------
Dependency scanning, tracking dependent packages or components, updating
dependencies.


Assuring Quality
----------------
Code coverage, automatic unit test writing...


Packaging
---------
